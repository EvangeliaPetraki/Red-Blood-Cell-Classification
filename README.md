# Fuzzy Logic-Based Red Blood Cell Segmentation and Classification in Pigeon Blood Smears

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of a Threshold-Based and a Fuzzy Logic-Based approach for the detection and classification of histopathological cells in pigeon (Columba livia) blood smear images. These methods were developed to aid the diagnosis of Haemoproteus columbae, a common avian parasite, and to automate an otherwise manual, subjective, and time-consuming microscopy process.
